#### Steam Web API Key

Steam has a big web API. To use the API, you'll need an API key. You can create your API key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey). Currently, there is no use of the steam web API Key. There will be a big update in the future, you'll need the API key. You can add the key now if you want, but there is no need to create one right now.
